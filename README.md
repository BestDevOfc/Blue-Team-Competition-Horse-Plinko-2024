# Blue-Team-Competition-Horse-Plinko
This was for the UCF 2023 horse plinko blue team competition. These scripts were imperative in 30 minutes my whole machine was secure and good to go for most of the competition.


## Some pointers for the future teams 
For anyone doing it if you’re reading this don’t install Fail2Ban it’s overkill and tbh it’s a pain because if it blocks the scoring bot you’ll now have a headache . Moreover, for VAFTPD there are numerous ports opened to download files so you can’t just hard UFW block you’ll need to first reinstall then upgrade VSFTPD bcs of smiley back doors and remove any backfired configs put by red teamer scripts 


We got second place, we would've gotten 1st if we prepared more, probably shouldn't read the packet the day before the competition.
